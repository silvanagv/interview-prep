// Welcome. In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet. If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it. a being 1, b being 2, etc. As an example:

// alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.") "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11"

function alphabetPosition(text) {


  const alphabetString = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

  return text;
}



//generate string with each letter in the alphabet corresponding to a position (obj?)
//create a new empty string
//go through each letter in the original string and add a number to the new string based on it's corresponding value
//if not a letter, ignore it and DON'T return it.
