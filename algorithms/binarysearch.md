Binary search is an algorithm that is used to efficiently find an item from an *ordered* list.

You repeatedly divide in half the part of the list that could contain the item based on some criterion, until you have only one item left. It's way more efficient than linear search, or going through every item until you get to the one you want, especially when dealing with extremely long lists.

As with anything in programming, precision is key when creating algorithms. You must know the inputs, outputs, variables and initial values for those variables.
