Binding - The bind method (all functions have it) creates a new function that will call the original function but with some of the arguments already fixed.

Closure - A closure is what happens to local variables the the function call that created them no longer exists. It is an inner function that has access to the outer function's variables.

Local scope - The parameters and variables declared inside a function. Local to the function, not visible from the outside. They're recreated each time the function is called.
