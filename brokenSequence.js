// You have a sequence of positive numbers starting with 1, but one number is missing!

// Find out the missing number; if the sequence is not broken, you should return 0. Each sequence always increments by 1.

// In short: an invalid sequence (a string with non numeric character) must return 1, an already complete (or empty) sequence must return 0; a broken sequence with more than one number missing should return the lowest missing number; otherwise return the missing number.

// Note that the input may be with random order.
